## Daniela Aros Mualin

Welcome! I am a botanist from Chile, currently doing a PhD student at the [University of Zurich](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/teaching/phd/graduate.html) working in the lab of [Dr. Michael Kessler](https://www.systbot.uzh.ch/de/research/kessler-group/MichaelKessler.html). My research interest are plant ecophysiology and ecology, specifically how plant water-carbon relations changes with their environment, and better yet if I can study this from an evolutionary standpoint. This is what encourage me to study ferns since they are an ancient plant lineage that is severely understudied.
